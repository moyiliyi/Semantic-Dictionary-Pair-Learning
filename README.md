# Semantic-Dictionary-Pair-Learning
We improve the Projective Dictionary Pair Learning (http://papers.nips.cc/paper/5600-projective-dictionary-pair-learning-for-pattern-classification) for image semantic prediction. We added supervised semantic information to DPL and improved the framework with constrain on labels. Test on Animals with Attributes dataset.
